Using employee dataset gotten from kaggle, I investigate employee attrition using a dataset that includes demographic and job information. The goal of using characteristics such as age, gender, work function, and monthly pay is to better understand the factors that influence turnover rates. Using this data, I hope to create predictive models to identify employees who are at danger of leaving, allowing organizations to execute targeted retention tactics and establish a pleasant work environment that promotes long-term employee happiness and retention.
the analysis and modelling of employee attrition statistics provide useful insights into the organization's personnel dynamics and financial issues. We obtained a better understanding of attrition, employee demographics, and income distribution by using statistical analysis, clustering, and fitting approaches. These insights enable decision-makers to apply focused strategies for talent retention, resource allocation, and general organizational improvement, resulting in a more engaged and productive staff while increasing the company's bottom line.
